LinguaLens is a mobile language-learning companion built for Android with Jetpack Compose. Point your camera at any object, and the app will use a powerful on-device machine learning model to detect the object and show you its name - both in your native language and a target language you select.

It's a fun, interactive way to build your vocabulary by associating words with the real world around you.

## ✨ Features

  * **Real-Time Object Detection:** Uses an on-device **ML Kit** model to find and identify objects in the live camera feed.
  * **Instant Translation:** Translates the detected object's name into one of several target languages, also using an on-device ML Kit model.
  * **Interactive Overlays:** Displays bounding boxes and dual-language labels (native + translated) directly on the camera view.
  * **Language Selector:** Easily switch your target translation language from a dropdown menu.
  * **Save for Later:** Tap on a detected object to capture the image and translation.
  * **Favorites Gallery:** A dedicated screen to browse all your saved image-translations, persisted locally using a **Room** database.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

This project is a modern Android application built entirely in **Kotlin** and leverages the latest Jetpack libraries.

- **UI:** **Jetpack Compose** (for a modern, declarative UI).
- **Navigation:** **Compose Navigation** (for handling screen transitions).
- **Camera:** **CameraX** (for a lifecycle-aware camera preview and analysis stream).
- **Machine Learning:** **Google's ML Kit** for on-device:
  - Object Detection
  - Translation
- **Database:** **Room** (for persisting saved translations in the "Favorites" list).
- **Permissions:** Built-in **Activity Result APIs** (to handle the camera permission request).
- **Architecture:** Follows recommended Android architecture principles (MVVM-inspired).

## 🚀 Getting Started
